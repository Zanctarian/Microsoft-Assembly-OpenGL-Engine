This project is for entirely the sake of self-study and experimentation. I will not be accepting any PRs nor will enable issues. Please use this as a reference for anything you may be working on and feel free to fork. I will, however, be updating results over time.

This project uses Visual Studio 2022 with build tools v143. To run, simply clone the repository, add the project as a solution (aka open sln file), link any libraries that may need to be linked (like glew in solution linker or files inside folders via main.asm linker), then hit play. This uses x64 MASM.

Remember: Link the libraries!!
